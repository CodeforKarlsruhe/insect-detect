This repository contains Python scripts and a YOLOv5s detection model (.blob format) for
testing the DIY camera trap system for automated insect monitoring.

## Installation

Instructions on how to install all required Python packages can be found in the
[**Insect Detect Docs**](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/software/pisetup/#oak-1-configuration) ðŸ“‘.

## Processing pipeline

More information about the processing pipeline can be found in the
[**Insect Detect Docs**](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/detection/) ðŸ“‘.

Processing pipeline for the `yolov5_tracker_save_hqsync.py` script:

- The object tracker output (+ passthrough detections) from inference on LQ frames (e.g. 416x416) is synchronized
  with HQ frames (e.g. 3840x2160) in a script node on-device, using the respective sequence numbers.
- Detections (area of the bounding box) are cropped from the synced HQ frames and saved to .jpg.
- All relevant metadata from the detection model and tracker output (timestamp, label, confidence score, tracking ID,
  relative bbox coordinates, .jpg file path) is saved to a metadata .csv file for each cropped detection.

## DIY camera trap

The DIY camera trap for automated insect monitoring is composed of low-cost off-the-shelf hardware components,
combined with completely open source software and can be easily assembled and set up with the
[provided instructions](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/hardware/).
All Python scripts for testing the system, data collection and continuous automated monitoring can be adapted
to different use cases by changing only a few lines of code.
