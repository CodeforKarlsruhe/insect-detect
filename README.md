This repository contains Python scripts and a [YOLOv5s](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
detection model ([.blob format](https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/pages/model_conversion/))
for testing and deploying the Insect Detect DIY camera trap for automated insect monitoring.
The camera trap system is composed of low-cost off-the-shelf hardware components
([Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/),
[Luxonis OAK-1](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/BW1093.html),
[PiJuice Zero pHAT](https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/pijuice-zero)), combined with
open source software and can be easily assembled and set up with the
[provided instructions](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/).

## Installation

Instructions on how to install all required Python packages can be found in the
[**Insect Detect Docs**](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/software/pisetup/#oak-1-configuration) ðŸ“‘.

## Processing pipeline

More information about the processing pipeline can be found in the
[**Insect Detect Docs**](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/detection/) ðŸ“‘.

Processing pipeline for the `yolov5_tracker_save_hqsync.py` script that can be used for
continuous automated insect monitoring:

- The object tracker output (+ passthrough detections) from inference on LQ frames (e.g. 416x416) is synchronized
  with HQ frames (e.g. 3840x2160) in a script node on-device (OAK), using the respective sequence numbers.
- Detections (area of the bounding box) are cropped from the synced HQ frames and saved to .jpg.
- All relevant metadata from the detection model and tracker output (timestamp, label, confidence score, tracking ID,
  relative bbox coordinates, .jpg file path) is saved to a metadata .csv file for each cropped detection.
