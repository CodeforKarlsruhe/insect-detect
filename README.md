This repository contains Python scripts and [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5),
[YOLOv6](https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6), [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7)
and [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) object detection models
([.blob format](https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/pages/model_conversion/)) for testing
and deploying the **Insect Detect** DIY camera trap for automated insect monitoring.

The camera trap system is composed of low-cost off-the-shelf hardware components
([Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/),
[Luxonis OAK-1](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/BW1093.html),
[PiJuice Zero pHAT](https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/pijuice-zero)), combined with
open source software and can be easily assembled and set up with the
[provided instructions](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/).

**Table Notes**

- All models were trained to 300 epochs with batch size 32 and default hyperparameters. Reproduce the
  model training with the provided [Google Colab notebooks](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-ml#model-training).
- Trained on [Insect_Detect_detection](https://universe.roboflow.com/maximilian-sittinger/insect_detect_detection)
  dataset [version 7](https://universe.roboflow.com/maximilian-sittinger/insect_detect_detection/dataset/7),
  downscaled to 320x320 pixel with only 1 class ("insect").
- Model metrics (mAP, Precision, Recall) are shown for the original PyTorch (.pt) model before conversion to ONNX ->
  OpenVINO -> .blob format. Reproduce metrics by using the respective model validation method (e.g. `val.py` for YOLOv5).
- Speed (fps) is shown for the converted models (.blob 4 shaves), running on OAK-1 connected to RPi Zero 2 W (same speed with
  object tracker). Set `cam_rgb.setFps()` to the respective fps shown for each model to reproduce the speed measurements.
- While connected via SSH (X11 forwarding of the frames), print fps to the console and comment out `cv2.imshow()`,
  as forwarding the frames will significantly slow down the received message output and thereby fps. If you
  are using a Raspberry Pi 4 B connected to a screen, fps will be correctly shown in the livestream (see gif).

## Processing pipeline

More information about the processing pipeline can be found in the
[**Insect Detect Docs**](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/detection/) ðŸ“‘.

Processing pipeline for the
[`yolo_tracker_save_hqsync.py`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect/blob/main/yolo_tracker_save_hqsync.py)
script that can be used for continuous automated insect monitoring:

- The object tracker output (+ passthrough detections) from inference on LQ frames (e.g. 320x320) is synchronized
  with HQ frames (e.g. 3840x2160) in a script node on-device (OAK), using the respective sequence numbers.
- Detections (area of the bounding box) are cropped from the synced HQ frames and saved to .jpg.
- All relevant metadata from the detection model and tracker output (timestamp, label, confidence score, tracking ID,
  relative bbox coordinates, .jpg file path) is saved to a metadata .csv file for each cropped detection.

Check out the [classification instructions](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/classification/)
and the [`insect-detect-ml`](https://github.com/maxsitt/insect-detect-ml) GitHub repo for more information on how to
classify the cropped detections. Take a look at the [analysis instructions](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/deployment/analysis/)
for more information on how to post-process and analyze the combined metadata and classification results.
